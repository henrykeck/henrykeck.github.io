                            <h2>The Keck Paperhanging Legacy</h2>
                            <p>Founded in 2022, Keck Paperhanging is a testament to the rich heritage of wallpaper craftsmanship within the Keck family. Originating from the lineage of Bob Keck, the founder of Quality Paperhanging, our story is woven with threads of passion, dedication, and artistry.</p>
                            <p>Dave Keck has dedicated over a quarter-century to mastering the art of wallpapering. His journey in the craft has been enriched by the shared experiences and knowledge of his family, especially his brothers. While each has taken their path, they have collectively adorned countless spaces, making the Keck name synonymous with quality, precision, and timeless elegance in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
                            <p>Our commitment is to continue the tradition of transforming spaces with elegance, character, and precision. With every project, we aim to reflect the values, traditions, and unmatched expertise that the Keck family name represents.</p>
                            <p>Join our journey and experience the legacy we bring to every space, resonating with timeless beauty and charm.</p>

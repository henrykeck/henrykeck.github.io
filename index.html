                    <h2>A Legacy in the Pacific Northwest</h2>
                    <p>Since 1990, the Keck family has been an emblem of craftsmanship in the Pacific Northwest's wallpaper scene. It's more than just a business; it's a passion born from our roots in the region.</p>
                    <p>Dave Keck, the heart and soul of Keck Paperhanging, didn't wait for adulthood to dive into the art of wallpaper. His journey began as a teenager, right in the Treasure Valley. This early start, coupled with his undying passion, has made Dave a trusted figure in the community.</p>
                    <p>Together with his brothers and friends, they've given walls life and character, adorning homes and spaces for over 25 years. It's not just about wallpaper. It's about history, dedication, and the joy of serving a community we deeply cherish.</p>
